# premier-league-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Football-Data API on AWS. The pipeline retrieves Premier League match data, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into AWS data stores for querying and analysis.
